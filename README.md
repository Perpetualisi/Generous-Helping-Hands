Hey! This is **Generous Helping Hands**, a website I built for an NGO.

The idea is simple: help people find programs, events, and ways to volunteer — and make donating super easy.

I built it using **React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS**, and it works nicely on both desktop and mobile. It also has **dark mode**, smooth scrolling, and a responsive Navbar with dropdowns.

## Built With

* React
* TypeScript
* Vite
* Tailwind CSS
* Fully responsive design

---

## What It Does

Here’s what I added:

* Sticky Navbar that **shrinks when you scroll**
* Smooth scroll to all sections (Home, About, Programs, Get Involved, Testimonials, Contact)
* **Dark/Light mode toggle** that remembers your choice
* Mobile menu with dropdowns and cool animations
* Donate button that’s easy to find
* Sections for Mission Statement, Vision Statement, Team, Programs, and Events

Basically, it’s clean, fast, and simple to use.
